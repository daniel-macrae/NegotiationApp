Game of Nines for Cognitive Modelling: Complex Behaviour


Bugs & Things to work on:

- // (done but maybe needs some adjustments) I fixed a weird thing if you press "Load Session" or "New Player", the background moves slightly, but now its more clear that the "Back" buttons are changing, but I can't work out how to fix this. Perhaps the player selection pages just need to be split up into 3 different views. But I think maybe we ask Luka about this first, because the navigation links are messy.

- Increase set of messages. 
- The back button on the contentView disappears if you finish a game, then press "new game" on the end-game screen (ask Luka to look at because the back buttons are driving me insane, idk where this one is defined at all).

- Buttons on the gameOverView should be lower? I think they look a little awkward. maybe they should be on top of each other as well.

- not allowing to send new MNs before the new MNSs are assigned. 

- Change icon colours
